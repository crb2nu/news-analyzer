Below is a practical, phased roadmap for using OpenAI Codex/GPT‑4o as your pair‑programmer to build an end‑to‑end system that (1) logs into swvatoday.com’s e‑edition, (2) extracts and summarizes new articles, and (3) delivers notifications or a lightweight “personal news app.”  Topics are ordered so that each phase is small, testable, and keeps you on the right side of both engineering risk and publisher terms‑of‑service (ToS).

0  |  Groundwork & Compliance  (½ day)

Task	Details & Codex prompt ideas
0.1  Check rights	Confirm the site’s ToS and your subscription permit personal, automated access. If the robots.txt blocks scraping (it does on anonymous requests), document that your authenticated session is exempt or contact the publisher for explicit permission.
0.2  Project skeleton	Create a private git repo with a ./scraper, ./summarizer, ./notifier, and ./infra folder. Codex prompt: “Generate a poetry init for a Python 3.11 project with Playwright, trafilatura, pdfminer‑six, openai, pydantic, and dotenv.”

1  |  Authenticated Scraper MVP  (1–2 days)

Task	Deliverable	Key choices / Codex prompt examples
1.1  Credential handling	.env file read by Pydantic settings class; secrets mounted through Kubernetes Secret or Doppler	“Write a Pydantic Settings class that loads EEDITION_USER, EEDITION_PASS.”
1.2  Login flow (Playwright)	Headless script that yields an authenticated browser context and storage state JSON file for reuse	“Using Playwright Python, script logging into https://swvatoday.com/eedition/smyth_county/, save storage state, and exit.”
1.3  Edition discovery	CLI: python scraper/get_today_urls.py --date 2025‑07‑07 → list of page or PDF URLs	Decide whether the e‑edition is PDF‑based (PageSuite often is) or HTML. Use DevTools to inspect once, then codify a selector.
1.4  Download & cache	Each URL ➜ ./cache/YYYY‑MM‑DD/raw/* (idempotent, hashed filenames)	“Given a list of URLs and a target folder, download only if not already present, add exponential back‑off.”

Checkpoint: Schedule a GitHub Actions/K8s CronJob that refreshes the storage state weekly and runs the scraper daily at 06:00 local.

2  |  Text Extraction & Cleaning  (1 day)

Task	Deliverable	Notes / Codex prompts
2.1  PDF vs HTML pipeline	• extract_pdf_text(path) → Article[] using pdfminer‑six + simple rule‑based page splits • extract_html_text(page_html) → Article[] using trafilatura or BeautifulSoup	“Implement a function that returns structured Article(title, body, section, page_no) dataclasses.”
2.2  Deduplication	SQLite/PostgreSQL table with (hash, edition_date); skip if hash exists	“Create SQLAlchemy model and upsert helper for article hashes.”
2.3  Unit tests	Pytest fixtures for sample PDFs/HTML	Codex can autogenerate boilerplate tests; supply sample files in tests/fixtures/.

3  |  AI Summarization Service  (1 day)

Component	Description
Summary granularity	Per‑article (≈ 200–300 words) plus a daily bulletin (≈ 5‑7 bullet highlights).
Prompt template	You are a local‑news assistant… [system]  Summarize the article in ≤200 words…  Include JSON Schema so output is machine‑parseable.
Streaming & cost control	Send only clean article body (no OCR noise). Use token‑clipped excerpts if body > 6 k tokens.
Orchestration	Simple FastAPI service /summarize → lambda‑style call you can reuse in notifier.
Codex prompt	“Write a FastAPI endpoint that accepts ArticleIn, calls the OpenAI API with a prompt template, and returns SummaryOut.”


⸻

4  |  Notification Layer  (1–2 days)

Choose any (or all) channels:

Channel	Library / Service	Codex prompts
Email digest	SendGrid (free tier) or Amazon SES	“Compose an HTML email with sectioned summaries, include original links and ‘Read more’.”
Mobile push	Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) via a small React‑Native or Flutter shell app.	“Write a Node.js Cloud Function that receives SummaryOut JSON via Pub/Sub and issues an FCM notification.”
ChatOps	Slack or Discord webhook for tech‑savvy consumption	“Post top 5 headlines as rich embeds with article link and summary.”

A single Notifier daemon watches the DB for new summaries and routes them through the chosen channel(s).

5  |  “Personal News App” Frontend  (optional, 3–5 days)

Minimal PWA or mobile app that:
	1.	Authenticates with your backend (JWT).
	2.	Shows a feed grouped by edition date.
	3.	Stores read state locally.
	4.	Allows push‑settings (sections, keywords).

Leverage your existing home‑lab Kubernetes cluster:

graph TD
  subgraph K3s
    scraper(CronJob:scraper) --> rawCache[(MinIO/FS)]
    rawCache --> extractor(Job:extract)
    extractor -->|Article| postgres[(PostgreSQL)]
    postgres --> summarizer(Job:summarize)
    summarizer --> notifier(Deployment:notifier)
    notifier -->|Email/Push/Chat| User
    frontend(Ingress React PWA) <---> postgres
  end


⸻

6  |  Ops & Monitoring  (½ day)

What	How
CI/CD	GitHub Actions → build multi‑arch Docker images; push to harbor.lan/library/localnews:*.
Observability	Grafana + Loki logs for scraper errors; Alertmanager email if >25 % pages fail three runs in a row.
Secrets	Use kubectl create secret generic swva-cred --from-literal=USER=… and mount as env.


⸻

7  |  Timeline & Milestones

Day	Milestone
1	Repo + secrets + Playwright login working
2	Daily scraper downloads PDFs/HTML into cache
3	Reliable text extraction & DB dedupe
4	Summaries generated via OpenAI; manual email proof
5	Automated email/Slack notifications; deployed CronJobs
6–7	Optional PWA/mobile shell with push; polish dashboards


⸻

8  |  Future Enhancements
	•	Keyword alerts (regex or semantic search with embeddings + pgvector).
	•	Audio briefings – feed summaries to TTS (e.g., Amazon Polly) and generate a daily podcast.
	•	Multi‑paper support – parametrize scraper so new e‑edition URLs are a config entry.
	•	RAG chatbot – answer questions like “What was the result of last night’s town‑council vote?” by searching stored article texts.

Putting Codex to Work Effectively
	1.	Short, atomic prompts (“Write Playwright code to click the login button, fill user/pass, and save storage state.”) give the best code.
	2.	Show Codex real DOM samples or PDF snippets when you need accurate selectors or text‑parsing heuristics.
	3.	Ask for tests directly: “Generate pytest cases covering happy path and expired‑cookie path.”
	4.	Iterate interactively – run generated code immediately, copy traceback back into the prompt: “Fix this KeyError in line 42.”

Follow this plan and you’ll have a self‑maintaining, legally compliant local‑news assistant that lands the day’s headlines in your inbox (or phone) before breakfast.
